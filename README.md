# Piazzanalytics

Piazzanalytics is a lightweight Google Chrome extension that generates some analytical visualizations that summarize Piazza posts. Allows filtering posts by type or posting date. Uses Chart.js and its box plot plugin.

Plots:
*  Daily post count history.
*  Stacked bar charts for post counts that correspond to specific day-hour pairs.
*  Box plots for the waiting time until an instructor (or an endorsed student) answers questions.
*  Tag popularity in descending order.

Use:
*  Install the extension.
*  Find the Piazzanalytics buttons in the top navigation or feed bars.
*  Click on one of the Piazzanalytics button to open the modal.
*  Set the parameters and generate the statistics. By default, the delay between API calls is 1 second, which means processing X posts roughly takes X seconds (date filters can speed up the process).
